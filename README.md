# dApp_p2p_energy_trading

## Description
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) for peer-to-peer energy trading. The dApp is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the Solidity programming language.

The dApp allows users:
- buy and sell energy from each other without the need for a centralized intermediary.
- uses smart contracts to facilitate the energy trading process and ensure that transactions are secure and transparent. 
- a user interface that allows users to interact with the smart contracts and view their energy trading history.
